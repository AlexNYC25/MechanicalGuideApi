# MechanicalGuideApi

## What is this for?
To serve as the go to API for finding out information on the wide variety of mechanical swithes 
for the mechanical keyboard community.

## Who can use this?
Currently this project is currently in development, with plans to eventualy host the project
online

## Why create this?
After entering the keyboard community in early 2021, I was overwhelmed with the number of choices I had with choosing 
what kind of mechanical switch I would use in building my own keyboard.

## How to use this?
Once the project is hosted on a hosting service, the API can be used without an api key, and used with the supplied documnetaion
in this **README.md**, to be updated later.
